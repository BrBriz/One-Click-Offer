# Versioning Scheme

We use a **X.X.X.X.x** versioning system, where each number represents a specific type of update:

- **First X (Major)** – Major updates that significantly change the core functionality of the program.  
- **Second X (Feature)** – New features or enhancements that add new functionality.  
- **Third X (UI/UX)** – Changes in the user interface and design updates.  
- **Fourth X (Fixes & Patches)** – The last number of the bug that was fixed ([Issue](https://github.com/BrBriz/One-Click-Offer/issues)).  
- **Fifth x (Bad Fix)** - Possible under a problem fix version
